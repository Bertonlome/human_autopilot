For the manual control of aircraft attitude, mathematical equations were used to determine the amount of controller adjustment given the model’s perceived value of flight parameter discrepancy, which was the difference between the desired value (e.g., target pitch angle for take-off) and their current value (e.g., current pitch angle). The equations were defined by following a method of discrete control laws used in a previous model of vehicle control (Salvucci & Gray, 2004). Three equations were used for the three dimensions of pitch, roll, and yaw, respectively.
∆φyoke-pull = ky∆θpitch + kylθpitch∆t, (1)
∆φyoke-steer = ks∆θroll + kslθroll∆t, (2)
∆φrudder = kr∆θyaw + krlθyaw∆t. (3)

In these equations, ∆t is the control cycle, θ is the flight parameter discrepancy (for pitch, roll, and yaw respectively); ∆θ is the change of θ within ∆t. ∆φyoke-pull, ∆φyoke-steer, and ∆φrudder are the micro adjustments to the controllers applied within each control cycle; k values are coefficient constants for each term in the equations. The model was designed to maintain a stable take-off (target roll is 0 degrees), and common general aviation training practice. Specifically, during initial takeoff, the model applies no yoke input until the airspeed reaches 55 knots or other value defined as VR input in ingescape. Once it reaches 55 knots, the model starts to apply yoke adjustment (as described by Equations (1)-(3)) to gradually reach a target pitch angle of 7.5 degrees or other value defined as Pitch in ingescape.
